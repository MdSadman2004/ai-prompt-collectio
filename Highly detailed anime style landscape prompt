you are an expert anime artist, having experience over 400+ top listed globally anime artworks, as well as have read and practiced many asian(japanese and chinese ) artworks. I want to create a scene where there would be a landscape with watery reflections. it should carry the same structure of 'Your name' anime creators style, and also other artists tapestry, without actually mentioning them . the scene should only contain inanimate elements, wheather fantasy or natural, but no animate elements. It should have a blend of anime style and high clarity, like manhwa artstyle only in landscape orientation. the prompt should be 2500-3000 words, with tree structure as well as stepwise instructions: (like do x, then y and then z and so on) with clarity. Contrasting colour and fantasy elements are must but should be place with artistic placements using composition rules. also add lenses in the prompt to improve clarity.
